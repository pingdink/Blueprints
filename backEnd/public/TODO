JS backend with form AJAX? calls?


So HTML spa sent to client they can look around.
to register they create username password
	register 
		update db
			account created page generated
to login
	first html spa
		login
			load user html block and then load user specific data
Form validation done through button that runs client side JS and the JS communicates with the server. 
Form submission returns default client page or transition to client page
